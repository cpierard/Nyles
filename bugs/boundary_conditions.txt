Title: Unrealistic effects at the boundaries

Reporter: Markus

Experiments: freezing_water.py, rayleight_taylor_rotating.py

In the rotating rayleigh taylor experiment, the vorticity vor_k at the
boundary is wrong.

In the freezing water experiment, at the upper and lower boundaries,
unrealistic values of buoyancy develop.  This problem might be related
to problems with calculating vorticity at the boundaries.
