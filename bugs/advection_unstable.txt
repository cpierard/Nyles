Title: Advection model is unstable

Description:
 - with timestepping = LFAM3 and orderA = 1, the advection is unstable and explodes quickly.
 - with timestepping = EF and orderA = 5, the advection is unstable.  It stays on the order of unity but creates big oscillations
 - with timestepping = EF and orderA = 3, the advection is unstable.  It stays on the order of unity but creates oscillations (though less than as with 5)

Expected behaviour:
These three cases should behave like the following three, which seem to work:
 - with timestepping = EF    and orderA = 1, the advection seems to work
 - with timestepping = LFAM3 and orderA = 3, the advection seems to work
 - with timestepping = LFAM3 and orderA = 5, the advection seems to work
