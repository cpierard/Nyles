# Nyles

Nyles -- New Python LES (Large Eddy Simulation) -- is a code to simulate
incompressible flows.  It has several original features, especially its
way of handling the SGS (subgrid-scale) physics.  This is done by
upwinding the vorticity in the vortex force term, which shows up in the
covariant form of the momentum equation (Navier--Stokes equation).

The project started in 2019 as a GFD project with two graduate students
of Marine Physics and is in an *early stage of development*.
