# Nyles

Nyles is a New Python LES code, for incompressible flows. It has
several original features. The main one being its way of handling the
sgs physics. It handles it implicitely by upwinding the vorticity in
the vortex force term, that shows up in the covariant form of the
momentum equation.

The project started as a GFD project with two graduate Students in
Marine Physics.
