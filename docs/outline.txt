* We will work on several components

  - the data structure: how do we store the 3D arrays
        * we need to anticipate the halo fill

        * anticipate that we want to distringuish covariant and contravariant components, even though the distinction is trivial in Cartesian coordinates.

  - computation of the model r.h.s
        * our guidelines are: data contiguity + maximize computational intensity

  - multigrid

  - parallelization
        * write things to be as general as possible: subdomain partition can be anything (but power of 2)

        * halo fill: it should be flexible: fill only two faces, fill the 6 faces, fill the 6 faces and the 8 corners etc.

        * gather arrays and matrice A [for the multigrid]

* for each subroutine we should systematically write

  - write the docstring

  - write one or several tests


* at this stage of the development, don't be afraid to rewrite things
  completely => e.g. the datastructure is central and impacts a lot
  the way the rest of the code is written
